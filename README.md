## Inspiration
Many people actually don't want to hear or read the word "Phobia". So, that's why this chrome extension can help to stay away from that word by highlighting that word on any website.

## What it does
This a Chrome Extension to highlight the word "Phobia" on any website. 

## How we built it
I have used manifest.json to specify the metadata about my extension & JavaScript as the scripting language & CSS3 for adding the rainbow blinking effect on the word "Phobia".

## Challenges we ran into
The word itself was unable to replace with. That's why used a recursive approach to loop through all the element & their child elements & child of those child elements.

## What we learned
manifest.json creation & handling to create extensions

## What's next for Phobia Word Highlighter (Chrome Extension)
- Users will have an option to select if they want to read or see that word in any website.
